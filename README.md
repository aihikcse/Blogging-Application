# Blogging Application

This repository hosts the source code for a robust Blogging Application backend developed using **Java Spring Boot**, **JPA with Hibernate**, and **MySQL**. This README provides an overview of the project, including the technologies used, architecture, layers, and key features.

## Technologies Used âš™
- **Java Spring Boot** 
- **JPA with Hibernate**
- **MySQL**

## Architecture ðŸŽ¯
The application follows a scalable and robust architecture designed to efficiently manage data and provide seamless integration between the backend and the database. Key components of the architecture include:
- **Java Spring Boot**: Provides a powerful framework for building and deploying Java-based applications, offering features such as dependency injection and embedded HTTP servers.
- **JPA with Hibernate**: Enables object-relational mapping for Java applications, simplifying the interaction with the database and providing seamless data persistence.
- **MySQL**: Used as the relational database management system to store and manage blog-related data.

## Layers ðŸ’»
The application is structured into layers to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability:
1. **Controller Layer**: Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing inputs, and generating appropriate responses.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic of the application, including blog management, user authentication, and search functionality.
3. **Repository Layer**: Interfaces with the database using JPA repositories, performing CRUD operations and database transactions.
4. **Model Layer**: Defines the data models and entities used throughout the application, representing blog posts, users, and other entities.

## Features âœ¨
- **Robust Backend Infrastructure**: Developed a scalable backend infrastructure to handle blog-related operations efficiently.
- **Seamless Integration**: Utilized JDBC & Hibernate to ensure seamless integration between the backend and the MySQL database.
- **Search Functionality**: Implemented a search option that allows users to find blog titles matching specific keywords. The search results are displayed in a paginated manner, enhancing user experience and facilitating content discovery.
